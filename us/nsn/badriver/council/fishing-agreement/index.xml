    <heading>PREAMBLE</heading>
    <text>WHEREAS the State of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (hereafter referred to as the Department), the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (hereafter referred to as the Bad River Tribe) and the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewas (hereafter referred to as the Red Cliff Tribe, and collectively as the Tribes) agree that the Lake Superior fishery is an important resource which must be carefully managed, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS the Department and the Tribes agree that the management of the resource can best be handled on a cooperative basis, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS the Department and the Tribes establish as a goal a healthy and diverse Lake Superior ecosystem that supports fish species at levels needed to sustain viable fisheries, managed holistically through sounds science that respects reserved treaty rights and ensures the beneficial uses by Tribal and non-tribal fishers, families and communities for future generations, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS lake trout is the principal top predator in Lake Superior, the Parties agree that the goal is to maintain self-sustaining populations at or near carrying capacity, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, recognizing the key role sea lamprey control plays in maintaining selfsustaining lake trout populations, the Parties agree to work in unison to support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service efforts via the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission in reducing sea lamprey abundance to levels agreed upon by the Commission, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS after extensive negotiations the Department and the Tribes have agreed on a Comprehensive Plan for the cooperative management of the Lake Superior fishery, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS the Department has agreed to exceed a 50% allocation of the lake trout quota in exchange for protection of the sport fishery and other concessions, and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS it is the desire of the Department and the Tribes to reduce this Agreement to writing:</text>
    <text>NOW THEREFORE the Department and the Tribes agree as follows:</text>

    <text>LEAN LAKE TROUT QUOTAS &amp; ALLOCATION</text>
    <para>
      <num>A.</num>
      <text>The Parties agree that the Biological Committee shall, within three years, develop a lean lake trout model for WI-1 for consideration by Parties, with annual progress reports made during the annual meeting of the Parties. Until such time as the Parties agree to adopt a system for calculating the WI-1 quota, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-1 shall be fixed at 14,500 lean lake trout.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>B.</num>
      <text>An annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be calculated every three years or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties using the Lake Trout Statistical Catch at Age Model.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>C.</num>
      <text>To confine the lean lake trout mortality to a 42% total annual mortality rate, the annual lean lake trout quota for WI-2 shall be established as follows:</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>The Parties agree to estimate a quota based on an annual mortality of 42%.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>Age-specific instantaneous commercial fishing mortality will be set so that total annual mortality will be 42% for the age most vulnerable to commercial harvest.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>3.</num>
        <text>The recommended quota will be the average total harvest (sport and commercial) predicted for the next 3 years, based on assumed mortality rates and projected lake trout abundance as projected by the SCAA model.</text>
      </para>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>Lean lake trout allocations shall be derived as follows:</text>
      <para>
        <num>1.</num>
        <text>The initial quotas for WI-1 and WI-2 shall first be reduced by the numbers needed for assessment (WI-1: 500 for State; WI-2: 1000 for State, 500 per Tribe).</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>2.</num>
        <text>The remaining fish shall be divided equally between the State and the Tribes (combined).</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>3.</num>
        <text>The Tribal allocation in each zone shall be apportioned equally between the Bad River and Red Cliff Tribes.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>4.</num>
        <text>At this time the Tribes have less need of an allocation in WI-1 and more of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Conversely, at this time the State has more of a need for an allocation in WI-1 and less of a need for an allocation in WI-2. Hence the Parties agree to a voluntary, nonprecedential exchange of fish between WI-1 and WI-2. Bad River shall annually retain 500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 3,000 additional tags in WI-2. Red Cliff shall annually retain 1,500 tags in WI-1 and in exchange for 2,000 additional tags in WI-2. The State's annual allocation in WI-1 shall increase by 5,000 and decrease in WI-2 by 5,000.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>5.</num>
        <text>The State further agrees to annually transfer 6,000 tags from its WI-2 allocation to the Tribes in exchange for reduced commercial fishing within the Van Tassell's Point Restricted Fishing Area. The Tribes agree that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Bad River Tribe and that 3,000 of these tags shall be allocated to the Red Cliff.</text>

    <para>
      <num>E.</num>
      <text>For the 2018, 2019 and 2020 seasons, the lake trout quota and allocation shall be as follows:</text>

        <text>Bad River agrees to annually reserve 900 fish from its Tribal allocation for home-use harvest activity. Red Cliff agrees to annually reserve 400 fish from its Tribal allocation for home-use fishing. Any unused portion of these fish can be reallocated to the commercial component of the fishery no later than August 1. When and if home use fish are reallocated to the commercial fishery, a sum of 100 fish will be retained from the available balance for home use activity during the remainder of the quota year.
