      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Council finds that the lands now comprising the Bad River Reservation were traditional hunting grounds for the ancestors of the Tribe; that these lands were selected as a Reservation because of their wealth of fish, game, and wild rice; that deer have been a nutritional staple for members of the Tribe for generations beyond memory; that deer continue to provide a substantial portion of the protein and other nutritional needs of the Tribe's members; that high unemployment and cash-poor local economy indicate that deer will remain critical as a food source for the Tribe's members; that pressure on the deer population by non-member sport hunting reduces the availability of deer as a food source for members; that non-members flaunting of tribal conservation laws has contributed to a decline in the reservation deer population; and that effective regulation of both member and non-member hunting of deer is essential for the preservation of the species in numbers sufficient to supply the economic and nutritional needs of the Tribe's members.</text>

      <heading> Findings</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Council finds that the lands now comprising the Bad River Reservation were traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering grounds for the ancestors of the Tribe; that these lands were selected as a Reservation because of their wealth of fish, game, and wild rice; that wild rice has been a nutritional staple for members of the Tribe for generations beyond memory; that wild rice continues to provide a substantial portion of the protein and other nutritional needs of the Tribe's members; that the annual harvest of wild rice is a traditional event of long-standing cultural importance; that high unemployment and cash-poor local economy indicate that wild rice will remain critical as a food source for the Tribe's members; that one predictable source of cash income for the Tribe's members is the sale of wild rice to non-residents of the reservation; and that effective regulation of both member and non-member harvesting of wild rice is essential for the preservation of wild rice in amounts sufficient to supply the economic, nutritional, and cultural needs of the Tribe's members.</text>

      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Bad River Tribal Council finds that wetlands and watercourses are fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands provide important tribal/public benefits and ecological functions. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control, flood control, shoreline erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, open space, recreation opportunities, environmental niches, and most importantly the traditional, cultural, and spiritual aspects of our heritage.</text>
      <text>Previous construction, land development, and other impacts have displaced, polluted, or degraded many wetlands and forested flood plains. Piecemeal or cumulative losses continue to threaten the remaining wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens the public safety, health and general welfare of the Band. Preservation of the wetlands in a natural condition is necessary to maintain hydrologic, economic, recreational, subsistence, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic assets for current and future residents of the Bad River Reservation.</text>
      <text>It is therefore necessary for the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians (Bad River Tribe) to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands and activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely affect wetlands,</text>

      <heading>Purposes</heading>
      <text>It is the policy of the Bad River Tribe to require planning to avoid or minimize damage to wetlands; to require that activities not dependent upon wetland location be located at upland sites; to allow wetland losses only where all practical measures to avoid and minimize have been applied; to reduce losses from activities that are unavoidable and in the public interest; and to provide for the protection of wetlands under existing and additional ordinances adopted by the Tribe including management regulations, storm water management regulations, floodplain zoning; and to establish standards and procedures for the review and regulation of the use of wetlands and watercourses and the establishment of penalties for the violation of this ordinance.</text>
      <text>Furthermore, such development activities shall not threaten Tribal or public safety or cause nuisances by:</text>

The said wetlands map shall be updated either from on-site inspection by Bad River Natural Resources Department at their discretion and when the Wisconsin Wetlands Inventory maps are revised. The wetlands map shall serve as a general guide for the delineation of wetland boundaries. Field investigations to delineate the precise boundaries of wetlands on a project site shall be the responsibility of the applicant. In cases where the Bad River Tribe needs additional information to complete a permit application review, the Bad River Natural Resources Department may complete on site investigations of protected wetlands and watercourses at the expense of the applicant or require the applicant to provide such information.</text>
      <text>The Wetland Inventory Map shows only the general location of wetlands. The map should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The Wetland Inventory Map together with an explanatory letter is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. The Wetland Inventory Map shall be on file in the office of the Bad River Natural Resources Department.</text>

      <text>The determination of the boundaries of the wetland delineation shall be determined through a field review by a person who has received training and has two (2) years of documented experience in wetland delineation, if warranted. The wetland field determination shall be the responsibility of the applicant. The Wetland Inventory Map is to be used as a guide to the general location of wetlands. The applicant is required under Paragraph 323.12(b) of this ordinance to show a Wetland Delineation boundary on a scaled drawing submitted as part of the permit application. Wetland delineations shall be performed in accordance with the procedures specified in the 1987 Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual and any subsequent amendments. Evidence documenting the results of the boundary survey as well as course completion certificate and documented wetland delineation experience may be required by the Wetlands Ordinance Administrator.</text>
      <text>Where the Wetlands Ordinance Administrator performs a wetland determination at the request of the applicant, it shall be considered a final determination. Where the applicant has provided a determination of the wetland boundary, the Wetlands Ordinance Administrator shall verify the accuracy of, and may render adjustments to, the boundary delineation. In the event the adjusted boundary delineation is contested by the applicant, the Wetlands Ordinance Administrator shall, at the applicant's expense, obtain competent expert services to render a final delineation to the Wetlands Ordinance Administrator for final decision. The Wetlands Ordinance Administrator may use remote sensing, hydrology, soils, plant species, and other data, and consult with biologists, hydrologists, soil scientists, or other experts as needed to perform a final wetland determination.

      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Council finds that the fisheries of the Bad River Tribe, both on the reservation and in Lake Superior, constitute important communal resources possessed by the Tribe as a whole. The Bad River Tribe has a long history of lake and river fishing and a long history of respect for the fish its members pursue. Both before and after the treaty era, Bad River members fished for subsistence, consuming some of the fish they caught, and selling, on a subsistence level, others. Tribal members have also fished for market on a commercial scale, and the time is not so far past when commercial fishing wharves lined the Bad River at Old Odanah, home port to member-owned fishing steamers.</text>
      <text>The Tribe's interests in the fish of the reservation and of the Lake continue to today. Today's interest is to see that the fish populations survive for harvest tomorrow, and into generations yet unseen. The Tribe's interest is also to provide a source of subsistence - for home use consumption and also for small scale market activity - to its members. Finally, the Tribe's interest is to provide a stable, protected source for the livelihood of those of its members who pursue the Lake's fish on a commercial scale.</text>
      <text>To meet these interests, the Tribe has embarked on a cooperative management program with the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewas and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It is only through the joint efforts of the three sovereigns with rights in the Lakes' resources that effective regulation and equitable sharing of the resource can be achieved. This chapter is therefore promulgated.</text>

      <heading>Findings</heading>
      <text>The Tribal Council finds that the fisheries of the Bad River Tribe, both on the reservation and in Lake Superior, constitute important communal resources possessed by the Tribe as a whole. The Bad River Tribe has a long history of lake and river fishing and a long history of respect for the fish its members pursue. Both before and after the treaty era, Bad River members fished for subsistence, consuming some of the fish they caught, and selling, on a subsistence level, others. Tribal members have also fished for market on a commercial scale, and the time is not so far past when commercial fishing wharves lined the Bad River at Old Odanah, home port to member- owned fishing steamers.</text>
      <text>The Tribe's interests in the fish of the reservation and of the Lake continue to today. Today's interest is to see that the fish populations survive for harvest tomorrow, and into generations yet unseen. The Tribe's interest is also to provide a source of subsistence - for home use consumption and also for small scale market activity - to its members. Finally, the Tribe's interest is to provide a stable, protected source for the livelihood of those of its members who pursue the Lake's fish on a commercial scale.</text>
      <text>To meet these interests, the Tribe has embarked on a cooperative management program with the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. It is only through the joint efforts of the three sovereigns with rights in the Lakes' resources that effective regulation and equitable sharing of the resource can be achieved. This chapter is therefore promulgated.</text>

      <text>The Tribal Council finds that suitable solid waste disposal sites are not easily located. Those that are must be used in the most efficient manner. Items that can be recycled and thus kept out of landfills should be recycled. Inefficient, inappropriate, and unsanitary disposal of solid waste can have adverse impacts on the land and waters of the Bad River Reservation.</text>
