        <text>A resolution to create a motor vehicle code of the Tribal Court Code; relating to: the activities of persons within the boundaries of the reservation with respect to motor vehicles.</text>
        <text>Cases: County of Vilas v. Chapman, 122 Wis. 2d 211, 361 N.W. 2d-699 (1985) (state has non-criminal traffic jurisdiction over members of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa on reservation until the Tribe is enforcing its own code).</text>
        <text>By this Code, the Tribe asserts its exclusive jurisdiction over the non-criminal activities of its members with respect to motor vehicles owned or operated by its members on the reservation and all persons on tribally maintained roads.</text>
        <text>The Tribe asserts its concurrent jurisdiction over the non-criminal activities of non- members with respect to motor vehicles owned or operated by non-members on the reservation.</text>
        <text>The Tribal Council expressly determines that the activities of non-members with respect to motor vehicles, many of whom are residents of the Reservation or employees of the Tribe, directly effects the health and welfare of the Tribe's members, and the ability of the tribal government to carry on its operations in an orderly manner.</text>
        <text>This Code incorporates and applies state law in effect at the time of adoption. Any changes in state law shall automatically be incorporated and applied in this Code. It is contemplated that the governing body of the Tribe shall periodically review any changes in state law and reject any changes that do not further the purposes of this Code</text>
