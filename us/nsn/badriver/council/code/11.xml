If the Tribe opts not to offer health and/or disability insurance to its employees then there shall be no remedy available from the Tribe for injury sustained at the workplace.</text>

      <text>Eligibility for a claim for compensation is contingent upon an employee qualifying for health coverage and/or disability compensation. Criteria for qualification shall be approved by the Tribal Council and all benefits and eligibility requirements for compensation will be published and made widely available to all employees. At a minimum, the criteria shall include policies and procedures for timely notice from the employee to the Band of injury. The notice shall, at a minimum, include the date, time, nature of injury, and place of injury and any potential or actual witnesses to the injurious event. The notice shall be signed by the employee's supervisor. Further policies and procedures may be developed to supplement the above minimum requirements. Regardless of whether notice was received, if no payment of compensation, other than medical treatment or burial expense, is made, and no application is filed within 2 years from the date of the injury or death, or from the date of the employee or his or her dependent knew or ought to have known the nature of the disability and its relation to the employment, the right to compensation therefore is barred, except that the right to compensation is not barred if the employer knew or should have known, within the 2-year period, that the employee had sustained the injury on which the claim is based. Issuance of notice of a hearing on the Band's own motion has the same effect for the purposes of <cite path="ยง11.01.110">this section</cite> as the filing of an application.</text>

Certified reports of physicians, podiatrists, surgeons, dentists, psychologists and chiropractors, wherever licensed and practicing, who have examined or treated the claimant, and of experts, if the practitioner or expert consents to subject himself or herself to cross-examination also constitute prima facie evidence as to the matter contained in them.

Certified reports by doctors of dentistry are admissible as evidence of the diagnosis and necessity for treatment but not of disability. The record of a hospital or sanatorium in this state operated by any department or agency of the federal or state government or by any municipality, tribe, or of any other hospital or sanatorium in the State of Wisconsin which is satisfactory to the Tribal Council, established by certificate, affidavit or testimony of the supervising officer or other person having charge of such records, or of a physician, podiatrist, surgeon, dentist, psychologist or chiropractor to be the record of the patient in questions, and made in the regular course of examination of such patient, constitutes prima facie evidence in any worker's compensation proceeding as to the matter contained in it, to the extent that it is otherwise competent and relevant. The Tribal Council may, by rule, establish the qualifications of and the form used for certified reports submitted by experts who provide information concerning loss of earning capacity.
