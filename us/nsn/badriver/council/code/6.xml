        <text>The burden of proof rests upon the applicant to establish his or her eligibility for inclusion on an adoption ballot. Documentary evidence of eligibility includes but is not limited to birth certificates, death certificates, baptismal records, copies of probate findings, affidavits and records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Committee shall determine the weight and sufficiency of any documentary evidence used to establish eligibility and may require the production of additional evidence if the Committee determines that the evidence submitted is insufficient to establish eligibility. If an applicant fails to respond to the Committee's request for additional evidence within thirty (30) days, the Committee may refuse to recommend that application for approval to the Tribal Council. In addition, where the Committee determines that the documentary evidence provided in support of an application for enrollment is insufficient to establish eligibility for enrollment, the Committee may require an evidentiary hearing on the issue of eligibility. The Enrollment Clerk shall inform the applicant of the need for an evidentiary hearing by written notice, which notice shall also inform the applicant of the date, time and location of the hearing. The applicant may request that the hearing be rescheduled; any such request must be made within two weeks of the applicant's receipt of the notice hearing. The applicant and all witnesses in support of the application for enrollment must appear in person at any such evidentiary hearing. All testimony given shall be sworn. The Committee shall determine the weight and sufficiency of all evidence offered by the applicant to establish eligibility for enrollment and require as evidence of lineal descent that the applicant submit to blood or Deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] testing. DNA testing shall only recognized if performed at a bona fide laboratory employing current standards issued by either the "Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods" [TWGDAM] associated with the "California Association of Criminalist Ad Hoc Committee on DNA Quality Assurance" or the "American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors" [ASCLD]. Applicants shall pay for any and all testing required. Submission of DNA evidence of lineal descent shall occur by the following manner and method:</text>
