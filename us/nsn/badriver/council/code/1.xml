Briefs are made optional, in recognition that some parties appearing pro Se may not wish to file briefs but may rather wish to present their cases solely in oral argument. The notice of appeal (see <cite path="1.21.100|(a)">Sec. 1.21.100(a)</cite>) accordingly requires a short statement of the grounds for appeal and of the relief sought.

          <text>The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature, can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to itself decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed.</text>
          <text>Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in this section; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Council may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.</text>

          <text>Subsections (a) and (d) preserve the basic function of the appeals court as a court of review, not a court of initial determination. The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see as only it can do that the record is fully developed.</text>
          <text>Subsection (b) protects the court and parties from expending energy on issues that an appellant has no intention of pursuing.</text>
          <text>Subsection (c) states the principle that a court will not decide issues over which there is no current controversy. The controversy that existed during trial may be dispelled by the time of appeal. The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot. Since the issue could recur, but would always become moot before it was ready for decision, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</text>

      <text>If a tenant remains in possession without consent of his landlord after expiration of a lease or termination of a tenancy by notice given either landlord or the tenant, or after termination by valid agreement of the parties, the landlord may recover from the tenant damages suffered by the landlord because of the failure of the tenant to vacate within the time required. In absence of proof of greater damages, the landlord may recover as minimum damages twice the rental value apportioned on a daily basis for the time the tenant remains in possession. As used in <cite path="§1.24.170">this section</cite>, rental value means the amount for which the premises might reasonably have been rented, but not less than the amount actually paid or payable by the tenant for the prior rental period, and includes the money equivalent of any obligations undertaken by the tenant as part of the rental agreement, such as payment of taxes, insurance and repairs.</text>

        <text>Scope of section. If a tenant unjustifiably removes from the premises prior to the effective date for termination of his tenancy and defaults in payment of rent, or if the tenant is removed for failure to pay rent or any other breach of a lease, the landlord can recover rent and damages except amounts which he could mitigate in accordance with <cite path="§1.24.180">this section</cite>, unless he has expressly agreed to accept a surrender of the premises and end the tenant's liability. Except as the context may indicate otherwise, <cite path="§1.24.180">this section</cite> applies to the liability of a tenant under a lease, a periodic tenant, or an assignee of either.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>Measure of recovery. In any claim against a tenant for rent and damages, or for either, the amount of recovery is reduced by the net rent obtainable by reasonable efforts to re- rent the premises. Reasonable efforts mean those steps which the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course, provided that such steps are in accordance with local rental practice for similar properties. In the absence of proof that greater net rent is obtainable by reasonable efforts to re-rent the premises, the tenant is credited with rent actually received under a re-rental agreement minus expenses incurred as a reasonable incident of acts under sub. (d), including a fair proportion of any cost of remodeling or other capital improvements. In any case the landlord can recover, in addition to rent other elements of damage, all reasonable expenses of listing and advertising incurred in re-renting and attempting to re-rent (except as taken into account in computing the net rent under preceding sentence). If the landlord has used the premises as part of reasonable efforts to re-rent, under sub.(4)(c), the tenant is credited with the reasonable value of the use of the premises, which is presumed to be equal to the rent recoverable from the defendant unless the landlord proves otherwise. If the landlord has other similar premises for rent and receives an offer from a prospective tenant not obtained by the defendant, it is reasonable for the landlord to rent the other premises for his own account in preference to those vacated by the defaulting tenant.</text>

      <heading>Purpose</heading>
      <text>Children are the most important asset of the Bad River Tribe. In them lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Chippewa culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. Their health, safety, and welfare are paramount to the Tribe. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, mediation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment - but in all decisions made under this code the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.</text>

Whereupon, the court, if satisfied that the grounds of objection are prima facie valid, shall issue an order to show cause as aforesaid, returnable as the court directs, but not more than 14 days after the date of the order, which shall be served forthwith upon the applicants for the marriage license residing in the state, and upon the clerk and shall operate as a stay upon the issuance of the marriage license until further ordered; if either or both of the applicants are nonresidents of the state the order shall be served forthwith upon the nonresident by publication once in the Ashland Daily Press and by mailing a copy thereof to the nonresident at the address contained in the application.</text>

        <text>If a person during the lifetime of a husband or wife with whom the marriage is in force, enters into a subsequent marriage contract and the parties thereto live together thereafter as husband and wife, and such subsequent marriage contract was entered into by one of the parties in good faith, in the full belief that the former husband or wife was dead, or that the former marriage had been annulled, or dissolved by a divorce, or without knowledge of such former marriage, if they continue to live together as of the other party to such former marriage, if they continue to live together as husband and wife in good faith on the part of one of them, be held to have been legally married from and after the removal of such impediment and the issue of such subsequent marriage shall be considered as the marital issue of both parents.</text>

Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of "all rights" (or equivalent language) in the property or estate of a present or prospective spouse or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce is a waiver of all rights to elective share, homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance by each spouse in the property of the other and a renunciation of each of all benefits which would otherwise pass to them from the other by intestate succession or by virtue of the provisions of any will executed before the waiver or property settlement.</text>
