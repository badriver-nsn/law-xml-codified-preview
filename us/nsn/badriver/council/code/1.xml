        <text>Subsection (b) establishes the authority of the Court of Appeals to review the constitutionality of Tribal Council acts of whatever nature. Because tribal constitutions do not typically provide for a separation of powers between the judiciary and the other functions of the government, some question may be raised as to the implicit authority of the courts to review the acts of tribal government. Whatever the correct answer is to that question, this subsection delegates whatever authority is necessary to perform such review.</text>

      <text>Any final judgment or order of the Tribal Court may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. A final judgment or order is one which disposes of all issues in litigation between at least two parties to a case.</text>
      <text>

      </text>
      <text>All final judgments and orders may be appealed. Nothing but a final judgment or order may be appealed. If an order in a case leaves other matters to be decided, and does not completely settle all disputed issues between the parties, so that the Tribal Court still has work to do, then the order is not final and an appeal cannot be filed. In cases involving multiple parties, an order or judgment may dispose of all issues between two or more of the parties, and would therefore be appealable. In cases involving multiple issues, an order disposing of one or more issues may leave others as yet unresolved and would therefore not be appealable.</text>

        <text>The appeal is started by filing the notice of appeal, a simple form for which a model is provided as Official Form no. 1. A party other than the initial appellant may decide to appeal in light of the initial appellant's appeal and is therefore allowed additional time to do so after service of the first notice of appeal. The interest of parties in the security of judgments entered by the court requires that an appeal must be filed within the time prescribed or be forever waived. Calculation of time is prescribed by Sec. 121.17. Proper methods of service are prescribed by Sec. 121.18.</text>

        <text>A notice of appeal shall be filed by any party seeking review of a final judgment or order of the Tribal Court. The notice of appeal shall be filed and served, together with the request for transcript required by section 121.10(c), within the time prescribed by sec. 121.9 of this ordinance. The notice of appeal shall bear the caption and case number of the case in the Tribal Court and shall be labeled "Notice of Appeal." The notice of appeal shall identify by date, judge, and case number the judgment or order appealed, and shall state the substance of the judgment or order and whether the appellant appeals from the entirety of the judgment or order or from only part thereof, and if the latter, shall specify the part thereof. The notice of appeal shall also include a brief statement of the grounds for appeal and shall specify the precise relief sought. No appeal shall be dismissed for any formal defects in the notice of appeal as long as the matter appealed is clearly identified and filing and service are timely and properly made. If a notice of appeal does not contain every item required by this subsection, the Court of Appeals may make such orders as the interests of justice require.</text>
        <text>
          <u>Comment</u>
        </text>
        <text>The essence of the notice of appeal is to give fair notice to the other parties that what would otherwise be a final disposition of a case will not be final, and to allow the other parties to begin preparation for responding to the appeal or for filing a cross-appeal. The notice of appeal provided for in this section also requires a statement of the grounds for appeal and the relief sought, in the event an appellant appearing pro Se elects not to file a brief. Any party including in the notice of appeal the items listed in this subsection will be deemed to have clearly identified the matter appealed. A notice of appeal that fails to include all of the items listed in this subsection may cause the Court to expand the time for response, dismiss the appeal, or make other appropriate orders.</text>

        <text>The above rules are considered the minimum necessary for allowing the Court of Appeals to conduct its business in an efficient and just fashion. Briefing rules are purposely looser than in other jurisdictions to allow non-lawyers to represent themselves, or if otherwise permitted by the rules of the Tribal Court (see sec. 121.20), to represent others. Briefs are made optional, in recognition that some parties appearing pro Se may not wish to file briefs but may rather wish to present their cases solely in oral argument. The notice of appeal (see Sec. 121.10(a)) accordingly requires a short statement of the grounds for appeal and of the relief sought. A party may or may not be disadvantaged by failure to file a brief.</text>

          <u>Comment</u>
        </text>
        <text>The standard of review defines the relationship between the trial court and the appeals court. The standard of review seeks to allocate to each court that part of the judicial work which it can best do. The trial court is in the best position to weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility and is therefore sustained on such matters unless its findings are clearly erroneous. The trial court is in no better position to interpret the law than the appeals court; in fact, the appeals court has the luxury of being able to analyze the law away from the heat of trial and can better perform this task itself. The appeals court can therefore look at questions of law afresh and need not defer at all to the trial court. Discretionary questions by their nature, can result in different decisions when put to different decision makers. The function of the appeals court in reviewing a discretionary decision is not to itself decide the result it would choose, but to determine whether the trial court in fact exercised discretion and made a decision based on the applicable facts and law. The exercise of discretion is more than bald decision making and it is the task of the appeals court to see that the appropriate process was followed.</text>
        <text>Specific instances of common standard of review problems are listed in this section; for instance the definition of sentencing as a discretionary determination. These instances are not exclusive. The Tribal Council may provide by ordinance and the courts by decision the classification of other matters as factual, legal, or discretionary.</text>

          <u>Comment</u>
        </text>
        <text>Subsections (a) and (d) preserve the basic function of the appeals court as a court of review, not a court of initial determination. The trial court should have the first opportunity to consider all issues in litigation and to see as only it can do that the record is fully developed.</text>
        <text>Subsection (b) protects the court and parties from expending energy on issues that an appellant has no intention of pursuing.</text>
        <text>Subsection (c) states the principle that a court will not decide issues over which there is no current controversy. The controversy that existed during trial may be dispelled by the time of appeal. The exception to this rule is the type of case that may occur again but is likely never to survive long enough to receive appellate review. For instance, an individual may wish to challenge a court's suspension of his hunting and fishing rights for a period of three months, but by the completion of the appellate briefing schedule the suspension would be ended and the case moot. Since the issue could recur, but would always become moot before it was ready for decision, the mootness doctrine would be set aside.</text>

        <u>Comment</u>
      </text>
      <text>Law is developed by appeals cases which push against the limits of previously accepted doctrine. This section should not be lightly applied, or used in such a way that arguably meritorious appeals are discouraged. Frivolousness may be found, however, when an appeal is grounded neither on existing law nor on a good faith argument for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.</text>

      <text>If a tenant remains in possession without consent of his landlord after expiration of a lease or termination of a tenancy by notice given either landlord or the tenant, or after termination by valid agreement of the parties, the landlord may recover from the tenant damages suffered by the landlord because of the failure of the tenant to vacate within the time required. In absence of proof of greater damages, the landlord may recover as minimum damages twice the rental value apportioned on a daily basis for the time the tenant remains in possession. As used in this section, rental value means the amount for which the premises might reasonably have been rented, but not less than the amount actually paid or payable by the tenant for the prior rental period, and includes the money equivalent of any obligations undertaken by the tenant as part of the rental agreement, such as payment of taxes, insurance and repairs.</text>

        <text>Scope of section. If a tenant unjustifiably removes from the premises prior to the effective date for termination of his tenancy and defaults in payment of rent, or if the tenant is removed for failure to pay rent or any other breach of a lease, the landlord can recover rent and damages except amounts which he could mitigate in accordance with this section, unless he has expressly agreed to accept a surrender of the premises and end the tenant's liability. Except as the context may indicate otherwise, this section applies to the liability of a tenant under a lease, a periodic tenant, or an assignee of either.</text>

      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>Measure of recovery. In any claim against a tenant for rent and damages, or for either, the amount of recovery is reduced by the net rent obtainable by reasonable efforts to re- rent the premises. Reasonable efforts mean those steps which the landlord would have taken to rent the premises if they had been vacated in due course, provided that such steps are in accordance with local rental practice for similar properties. In the absence of proof that greater net rent is obtainable by reasonable efforts to re-rent the premises, the tenant is credited with rent actually received under a re-rental agreement minus expenses incurred as a reasonable incident of acts under sub. (d), including a fair proportion of any cost of remodeling or other capital improvements. In any case the landlord can recover, in addition to rent other elements of damage, all reasonable expenses of listing and advertising incurred in re-renting and attempting to re-rent (except as taken into account in computing the net rent under preceding sentence). If the landlord has used the premises as part of reasonable efforts to re-rent, under sub.(4)(c), the tenant is credited with the reasonable value of the use of the premises, which is presumed to be equal to the rent recoverable from the defendant unless the landlord proves otherwise. If the landlord has other similar premises for rent and receives an offer from a prospective tenant not obtained by the defendant, it is reasonable for the landlord to rent the other premises for his own account in preference to those vacated by the defaulting tenant.</text>

      <heading>Purpose</heading>
      <text>Children are the most important asset of the Bad River Tribe. In them lie the Tribe's future, and in their retention of Chippewa culture lies the preservation of the Tribe's past. Their health, safety, and welfare are paramount to the Tribe. It is the policy of the Tribe to strengthen family structures, to prevent family breakups, and to foster conditions favorable to the growth, spirit, culture, and individuality of each child. A child without knowledge of the past is directionless in the path forward; a child without a nurturing present is denied the strengths that lead to the future. It is the Tribe's policy to favor preventive action over belated reaction, mediation over confrontation, counseling over lecturing, conciliation over punishment - but in all decisions made under this code the welfare of the child shall be the ultimate touchstone.</text>
